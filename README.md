# Memristor-chaos
This webpage is a supplementary resource for our recently submitted paper "A magnetron memristor coupled with a heterogeneous cell neural network: design, analysis and circuit implementation", aiming to visually demonstrate the dynamic evolution behavior of memristor-coupled cell neural networks.
You can manually adjust key system parameters: By modifying coupling strength k, you can observe how the system's dynamics change under different memristor coupling intensities. Adjusting nonlinear coefficients alpha1 and alpha2 helps explore how these parameters regulate the coupling system's dynamic behavior. Through these interactive operations, you'll gain a clear understanding of the neural network's control mechanism and can apply the principles in practice. Once you master these core principles, you'll find their applications straightforward and intuitive, while the underlying dynamic mechanisms remain rich in research value.
