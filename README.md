# Memristor-chaos
This webpage is a supplementary resource for our recently submitted paper "A magnetron memristor coupled with a heterogeneous cell neural network: design, analysis and circuit implementation", aiming to visually demonstrate the dynamic evolution behavior of memristor-coupled cell neural networks.
